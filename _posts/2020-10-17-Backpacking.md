I'm lucky enough to know Dylan and Larry who, every once in a while, persuade me to do something besides the mundane routines of school or work. During the summer, we would play soccer some weekends, but the newest idea was a bit more involved: backpack along the Washington coast.

After copping a worthy rucksack for the trip, there was no backing out.

*yikes, wrong chat*

It turns out there's actually a lot of planning involved when you have to live out in the woods off of the items off your back for 3 days.

*the most important part of planning*

Besides the obvious things, we also had to get a bear cannister for the bears, a sleeping pad for sleep, and a water filter for water.

Looking back, I guess it was a good thing that I was already pretty committed to the plan. There were some bad wildfires that had covered Washington, and I wasn't particularly attached to the idea of breathing in smoke all night in a tent. Thankfully, (or so Dylan tried to convince us), the air quality was better out along the coast (although I'm pretty sure the hepa filters at my house were a much safer alternative).

*Good? Especially considering Seattle was well in the triple digits*

The ocean was beautiful, the sand soft, and we even briefly got to see the blue sky after a week+ of smoke back in the city. Don't ask me about the ramen we buried in the sand (since it didn't fit in the bear cannister). Oh and hiking boots are a must.

Here's the trip in 21 seconds:

*Someone (def not Dylan) left an eery message at our first campsite*

To walk along the coast, there were some parts that aren't trespassable during high tide so there were these rope ladders you would climb to walk inland for a bit.

We also had to bring water filters to protozoa or something. None of us got sick so I guess they worked? The water looked a little funny still to be honest.

*Bet you can't guess which one was the original water we brought*

While I brought way too many clothes, we didn't quite pack enough food. Sorry, I eat a lot >:). (We left a day early bc our rations were getting low lol)

The food we did pack was awesome. Mountain House is pretty amazing, and we cooked ramen, macncheese and brought some pasta in zip-lock bags.

There were also swarms of these sand fleas at some places. They honestly started becoming part of the environment and we got accustomed to their frantic dancing as we walked through them, but I'm also glad that they weren't everywhere all the time.

*The black stuff on the roots of that log are actually all fleas. We threw rocks at it and the whole swarm started dancing. It was pretty terrifying*

*There were a lot of these fun wrecking ball swing things*

On the way back, we splurged on some nice pizza and wings.

*Hmm, delicioso*
