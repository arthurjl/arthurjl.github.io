Hi! I've been pretty busy, and I didn't get to make time for some of the things that I find myself missing now.

It's been a lot of fun too, but also I'm glad that I've finally gotten an emptier weekend to breathe and reflect for a little. Recognizing the things that I want to prioritize (and also what to deprioritize) has left me a little more committed to the healthier hobbies and activities that I want to bring back.

One of those things is this blog.

It's crazy how the last published post was 8 months ago, and reopening this on my local machine, I forgot about how many draft posts or ideas I had started but not yet finished... and now there's even more.

To name a few:
* Weekly Wisdoms
* Hosted TEDxUofW 2021!
* I graduated!
* I'm working at Microsoft
* San Diego trip :D
* Started a company... VerbalEyes
* Giving Tech Labs BBQ Party
* Impending triathlon in a month (... a little spooky!)
* Soccer Intramurals

So, no promises, but I'll try publishing a bit more regularly by also keeping these posts a bit shorter... starting with this one! See you soon :D
