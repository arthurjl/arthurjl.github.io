This is the first (real) post on this website, and it's also the one I didn't want to write. When I kept journals, I always got stuck with the first few pages because I believed the first few pages are the most important. Reading those journals, I realize that I don't care that in 2012 my name is Arthur Liu, that I have a younger sister, that I play soccer, or that, fun fact!, I'm left-handed. Sure, those pages are quite entertaining, but what I really liked from those journals are the silly memories. All I really care from the intro, is the "who" and the "when".

But intro's seem important, and I still can't shake the feeling that all geneses deserve some special kind of ribbon-cutting celebration. So I've decidedly added a few more, perhaps extraneous, pieces to this introduction: A Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How.
