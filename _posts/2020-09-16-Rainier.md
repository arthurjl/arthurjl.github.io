The last time I went to Rainier, I remembered it was cloudy, not a whole lot of fun, and I don't remember much else because I was pretty little. For someone who's been living in Seattle for most of my life, I haven't gone to our famous mountain for quite a while.

One of our friends, Ryan, was leaving to spend the beginning of the next virtual quarter in Korea, so Daniel suggested that we hang out one last time to visit Rainier. The 3+ hr drive is not particularly trivial, but it was definitely worth it.

We took the Skyline trail at the base of the mountain, and the massive scale of Rainier almost feels unreal. At times, I couldn't wrap my head around how large it actually is when it looks so up close.
