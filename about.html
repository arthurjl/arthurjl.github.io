<p>Hello!</p>

<p>
My name is Arthur and welcome to my website. I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Washington with an interest
in machine learning. Besides coding, I enjoy soccer, play the piano (and a bit of viola), mess around in makerspaces, dabble in drawing (stick&nbsp;figures), and build effective PowerPoints. I've mostly just repeated myself from the homepage, but that's because it's "so nice, you say it twice!" (~ Moto Moto the Hippo).
</p>

<p>
I created this website over Winter break in 2018 to learn and sharpen some skills in web development. But more selfishly, I'll be maintaining a blog here to record the bits of life I'd hate to forget.
