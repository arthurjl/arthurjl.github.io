<p class = "centered">Hi there!</p>

<p>
My name is Arthur, and I'm studying computer science at the University of Washington. Recently, I just completed my degree in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship, and I'm working next on completing a masters in CS and a startup I co-founded called <a href="https://verbaleyes.co/" style="font-weight: bold">VerbalEyes</a>.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I was a distinguished AI research fellow at <a href="https://giving.tech/ai-for-good/" style="font-weight: bold">Giving Tech Labs</a> where I had the honor of publishing a paper on voice analysis techniques. I've also been a Software Engineer Intern at <span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft</span> working on their static analysis tools, and I've interned at <span style="font-weight: bold">Amazon</span> where I deployed a tool that associates use in their brick and mortar stores!
</p>

<p>
I created this website over Winter break in 2018 to learn and sharpen some skills in web development. But more selfishly, I'll be maintaining a blog here to record the bits of life I'd hate to forget.
