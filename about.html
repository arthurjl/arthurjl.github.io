<p class = "centered">Hello!</p>

<p>
My name is Arthur and I'm studying computer science at the University of Washington. Recently, I was a distinguished AI research fellow at <a href="https://giving.tech/ai-for-good/" style="font-weight: bold">Giving Tech Labs</a> where I had the honor of publishing a paper on voice analysis techniques. This last summer, I was a Software Engineer Intern at <span style="font-weight: bold">Amazon</span>, working on tools for Amazon's Go Stores. Currently, I'm a <span style="font-weight: bold">Head Teaching Assistant</span> for the intro CS courses here at UW.

I created this website over Winter break in 2018 to learn and sharpen some skills in web development. But more selfishly, I'll be maintaining a blog here to record the bits of life I'd hate to forget.
