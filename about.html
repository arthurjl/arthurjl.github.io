<p class = "centered">Hello!</p>

<p>
My name is Arthur and I'm studying computer science at the University of Washington. Recently, I've been an undergraduate teaching assistant for the introductory CS courses. Currently, I'm a research fellow at the Giving Tech Labs, developing work around artificial intelligence.

I created this website over Winter break in 2018 to learn and sharpen some skills in web development. But more selfishly, I'll be maintaining a blog here to record the bits of life I'd hate to forget.
