<p class = "centered">Hi there!</p>

<p>
My name is Arthur, and I'm a graduate from the University of Washington where I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degree in computer science. Nowadays, I am an incoming software engineer at Meta.
</p>

<p>During my time at UW, I also co-founded a startup called <a href="https://verbaleyes.co/" style="font-weight: bold">VerbalEyes</a> which was spun out of an entrepreneurship program. I also instructed <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/22su/" style="font-weight:bold">CSE332 over the Summer</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Previously, I was a distinguished AI research fellow at <a href="https://giving.tech/ai-for-good/" style="font-weight: bold">Giving Tech Labs</a> where I had the honor of publishing a paper on voice analysis techniques. I've also been a Software Engineer Intern at Microsoft working on their static analysis tools, and I've interned at Amazon where I deployed a tool that associates use in their brick and mortar stores.
</p>

<p>
I created this website over Winter break in 2018 to learn and sharpen some skills in web development. But more selfishly, I'll be maintaining a blog here to record the bits of life I'd hate to forget.
